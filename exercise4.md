# Exercise 4 - Test Coverage Report

## Test Cases Implemented:
- `add()`: Testing normal numbers, zero, and negative numbers.
- `minus()`: Testing normal numbers, zero, and negative numbers.
- `multiply()`: Testing normal numbers, zero, and negative numbers.
- `divide()`: Testing normal numbers, zero, and negative numbers.

## Test Coverage:
- The `factorial()` method is not yet implemented, so it does not appear in the test coverage report.
- The coverage report shows that all existing methods (`add()`, `minus()`, `divide()`, `multiply()`) are fully tested.
